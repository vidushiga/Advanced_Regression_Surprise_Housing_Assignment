## General Information
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The goal of the company is as follows: 
* Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
* Determine the optimal value of lambda for Ridge and Lasso Regression.
* This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
* The model will help the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The following factors influence the house price the most as demonstarted by both Ridge & Lasso Models:
* Total area in square foot
* Total Garage Area
* Total Rooms
* Overall Condition
* Lot Area
* Centrally Air Conditioned
* Total Porch Area(Open + Enclosed)
* Kitchen Quality
* Basement Quality
